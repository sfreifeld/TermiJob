Job Application Tracking:
Implement a feature to track job applications. Users can mark jobs as applied, pending, or rejected.
This requires adding a new table in the database and updating the Jobrecord class to handle application status.

Automated Job Alerts:
Enable users to subscribe to automated job alerts based on their preferences and keywords. This could involve setting up a 
simple scheduler that runs the job search periodically and notifies the user of new matches via email or within the application.

Integration with External Job Boards:
Expand the job search functionality by integrating with more job boards and platforms via their APIs,
increasing the variety and number of job listings available.
